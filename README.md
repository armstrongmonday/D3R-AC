# D3R·AC — Data-Driven Disaster Resilience for All Communities

**Blockchain-powered disaster resilience — predicting crises, delivering aid, and protecting communities before disaster strikes.**

Built by **TAAD (The Abuja Algorithmic Defenders)**

## What is D3R·AC?

D3R·AC is a proprietary, blockchain-based disaster resilience framework, built and owned by TAAD (The Abuja Algorithmic Defenders). It treats disaster relief as a data and infrastructure problem, not just a fundraising problem — using on-chain smart contracts to make fund disbursement transparent, auditable, and fast, instead of routed through opaque layers of intermediaries.

The system is built on three layers:

1. **Data layer** — ingests disaster-risk signals (hazard data, displacement indicators, infrastructure damage reports) to determine when and where resilience funding should be pre-positioned.
2. **Smart contract layer** — deployed across **TRON** and **Casper**, handling conditional, milestone-based, transparent fund release.
3. **Community access layer** — an interface for NGOs and local coordinators requiring zero blockchain literacy.

## The Risk Model

Disaster risk is modeled as a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability:

```
R(c, t) = H(t) · E(c) · V(c)
```

Where:
- `R(c, t)` — resilience-funding priority score for community `c` at time `t`
- `H(t)` — hazard probability at time `t`
- `E(c)` — exposure factor for community `c`
- `V(c)` — vulnerability index (infrastructure + socioeconomic data)

When `R(c, t)` crosses a defined threshold `θ`, a smart contract condition can trigger fund pre-positioning. Full derivation in [`docs/risk-model.md`](docs/risk-model.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Smart contracts:** Solidity (TRON/TVM), [Casper contract language — TBD]
- **Chains:** TRON, Casper Network
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Data pipeline:** Python, satellite/sensor ingestion (NASA FIRMS, USGS, NASA EONET, GDACS), Africa-prioritized — see [`data-pipeline/README.md`](data-pipeline/README.md)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Data-Driven-Disaster-Resilience/D3R-AC.git
cd D3R-AC
```

### Smart contracts (TRON)

See [`docs/deployment-guide.md`](docs/deployment-guide.md) for full deployment steps using TronIDE or TronBox. **Always deploy to testnet (Shasta/Nile) first.**

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Status

🚧 **Active development.** TRON smart contract suite implemented — token,
identity registry, milestone-based disbursement controller, a multisig
admin role, a central coordinator ("Hub") with full role/ownership
control over the other five contracts, an on-chain risk registry, and
a funding-request board (seven contracts total; see
[`contracts/tron/README.md`](contracts/tron/README.md)) — with a
**logic-tested suite (115 passing tests)**, but **not yet deployed to any
network and not yet professionally audited.** Frontend community access
layer implemented (TRON live, Casper adapter in place pending Casper
contract deployment). Data pipeline implemented per
[`docs/data-pipeline-srs.md`](docs/data-pipeline-srs.md) — satellite/sensor
hazard ingestion (NASA FIRMS, USGS, NASA EONET, GDACS), Africa-prioritized,
with a 24-test suite (see [`data-pipeline/README.md`](data-pipeline/README.md))
— but **not yet run against a deployed Hub/RiskRegistry**, since neither
is deployed to any network yet. Casper contracts are still not started.
The data pipeline SRS carries its own additional, even more restrictive
notice on top of the proprietary [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) that already
governs this entire repository.
